BIND can be told to serve a secondary zone from a file,
but that can't be text zone file, it has to be binary zone file.

The zone on bind9-2 is intentionally outdated, so Stork can
demonstrate the ability to detect zone serial mismatches.

If you ever need to update it, please put your changes in the
db.bind9.example.org.text file and run:

named-compilezone -f text -F raw -o db.bind9.example.org.raw bind9.example.org db.bind9.example.org
