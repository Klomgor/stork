      description: >-
        The Stork agents running on the machines where DNS servers are installed
        fetch the zones from these servers and store in the "zone inventories".
        This operation instructs the Stork server to communicate with the zone
        inventories on the respective agents to receive all zones. The received zones
        are fetched in the Stork server's database. This operation is a background
        task that may take significant amount of time, depending on the number of
        zones and DNS servers. Subsequent calls to this endpoint while this operation
        is still in progress are no-op.
