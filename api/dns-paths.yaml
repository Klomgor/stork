      description: >-
        The Stork agents running on the machines where DNS servers are installed
        fetch the zones from these servers and store in the "zone inventories".
        This operation instructs the Stork server to communicate with the zone
        inventories on the respective agents to receive all zones. The received zones
        are stored in the Stork server's database. It runs in background and may take
        significant amount of time, depending on the number of zones and DNS servers.
        Subsequent calls to this endpoint while this operation is still in progress
        are no-op.
