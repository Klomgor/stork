[func] piotrek

    Table filtering user experience was improved. Buttons toggling
    filtering panels are now better visible and accessible on the left
    side of the panel. Screen blinking does no longer occur when
    typing inside the filtering inputs. Number inputs no longer accept
    numeric zero filter value.
