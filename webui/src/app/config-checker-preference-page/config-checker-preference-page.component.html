        <p>This page displays the configurations of the review checkers.</p>
        <p>
            Stork can detect and report potential issues with the monitored servers' configurations. Dedicated
            "checkers" validate particular aspects of each configuration file, and generate reports with detailed
            descriptions and suggestions to eliminate the most typical errors and misconfigurations.
        </p>
        <p>
            If any configuration reports are not relevant in your deployment, they can be disabled globally or for
            selected daemons. Any disabled checkers are not run, which improves both the clarity of the reports list and
            Stork's performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the list on this page to disable or enable the checkers globally (i.e. for all daemons). To override
            this choice for individual daemons, choose the desired App Name in the Services Status section of the DHCP
            dashboard, and then click the <em>Checkers</em> button in the Configuration Review Reports section at the
            bottom of the page.
